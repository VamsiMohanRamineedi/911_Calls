# Exploratory Data Analysis of 911 calls

In this project, I am going to analyze some 911 call data available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert). 

### Software and libraries required:

  * Python
  * Jupyter Notebook
  * Numpy
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn

 > Alternatively, you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which comes preinstalled with all the above software and libraries.
